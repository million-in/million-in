# 👋 Hi, I’m Keza Yassin (@million-in)

🚀 **AI Researcher & Systems Engineer**  
I build at the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Distributed Infrastrcture Systems**, where every cycle, every bit, and every network packet matters.  
My work is about making systems that **run fast, scale seamlessly, and survive failure**.  

---

### 🔭 What I Do
- Architect **distributed systems** that don’t just scale, but self-heal under failure.  
- Push **deep learning models** to be faster, leaner, and deployable on imperfect hardware.  
- Engineer concurrency and bandwidth at the lowest possible cost.  

---

### 🤝 Collaboration
I’m interested in projects where:
- **AI research meets systems engineering** — models built for production, collaborative on new ideas to.  
- **High-performance infra** — pipelines, clusters, or networks that can’t afford downtime.  
- **Applied optimization** — turning raw research into robust, real-world engineering.  

---

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I spend more time **removing inefficiencies** than writing new features.  

---

### 🧑‍💻 Languages I Operate In
- **Python** — deep learning, rapid research, ML infra  
- **Go** — distributed systems, concurrency-heavy services  
- **C** — low-level performance and reliability under the hood  
- **TypeScript** — minimal UI when the system needs a face  

---

### 🎯 Outside of Day Work
- **Red Teaming**: I treat security as an engineering problem, and I enjoy *earning money by breaking assumptions* — hacking systems to make them stronger.  
I work as Red Team(contractor) for some of the best Model providers in the world, To push and enhance the the security of the best innovation humanity will create.
